Changes made to 10c (update on 02/16/22):

* Change to jsp generation. If generating boostrap, for the <nav sidebar, add class "contentExists" if there are menu options in the sidebar. This is used for showing/hiding sidebar.
* Jsp generation, add quotes around filename="filename" on file download because of issues in Chrome with files containing a comman in the filename.
* Widen the Global Operation operation list window.
